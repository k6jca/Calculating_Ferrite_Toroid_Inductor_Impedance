# Calculating_Ferrite_Toroid_Inductor_Impedance
Matlab script for calculating the impedance of an inductor wound on a Ferrite toroid core, using 
Fair-Rite data u' and u'' data downloadable (in a .csv file) from Fair-Rite's website.

The script uses an example inductor of 12 turns on a Mix 31 FT-240 core.  The .csv file data
is in the /Excel subdirectory.

MATLAB script tested with MATLAB version R2020a.  Note that you'll need at least version R2019a (to utilized the readmatrix() function, and at least version R2018Bb for the sgtitle() function.
